Project Idea: Library Management System

Create a Library Management System that allows users to manage a library's inventory, borrow books, and return books. Here are some key features you can include:

Classes:

Book: Representing individual books with attributes like title, author, ISBN.
Library: Managing the collection of books, providing methods to add books, remove books, and search for books.
Member: Representing library members with attributes like name, ID, and a list of borrowed books.
Functionality:

Add books to the library inventory.
Remove books from the library inventory.
Search for books by title.
Allow library members to borrow books.
Track borrowed books and their availability status.
Allow library members to return books.


Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks, plan your class structure and relationships, and implement them step by step. This project will help you strengthen your understanding of OOP principles in Python and provide hands-on experience in building a real-world-like application.
